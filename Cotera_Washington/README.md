# Brainfuck Interpreter in Clojure

This is a simple implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter in the Clojure programming language. The program can be executed in two ways:

## 1. Direct String Processing

    You can pass the Brainfuck code as a string directly to the program. For example:

        $ lein run "++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++.-.<<++.>>-----------.+++++++++++.<<.>>------------.---.+++++++++++++.-------------.<<<."

## 2. File Processing

    You can also pass the path to a file containing the Brainfuck code to the program. For example:

        $ lein run path/file.txt


## Prerequisites

    * Leiningen
    * Java 8 or higher

## Running the Program

    1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    3. Run the following command to execute the program:

        $ lein run <input>

    Where <input> is either the Brainfuck code string or the path to the file containing the code.
